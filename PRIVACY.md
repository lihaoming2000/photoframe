## Information Collection and Use

The Application is designed with privacy in mind and collects minimal information:

### What We Collect
- **Location Data**: Used solely to display local weather information. Location data is only used to fetch weather from third-party weather services and is not stored or transmitted to the Service Provider.
- **Photos Access**: The Application accesses your photo library only to display photos you select. Photos remain on your device and are never uploaded or transmitted.

### What We DON'T Collect

## Third Party Services

The Application uses the following third-party service:
- **wttr.in**: A weather service that provides weather information based on location. This service may collect your approximate location (city level) to provide weather data. Please refer to wttr.in's privacy policy for more information.

## Data Storage

- All data (selected albums, playback preferences) is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to or stored on external servers controlled by the Service Provider
- No user accounts or cloud synchronization

## Children's Privacy

The Application does not collect any personal information from users of any age, including children under 13. The Application is suitable for all ages as it only displays photos stored on the user's device.

## Security

Since the Application does not collect or transmit personal data, and all functionality operates locally on your device, your information remains secure on your own device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
